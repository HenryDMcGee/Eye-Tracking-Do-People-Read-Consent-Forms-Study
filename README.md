# Eye-Tracking-Do-People-Read-Consent-Forms-Study

-Worked in a group of 4(including a graduate psychology student)
-Sent forms to IRB 
-Used Gazepoint to analyze whether or not people read a consent form (informed or not informed there would be a quiz afterwards was our independent variable)
-Was a concealment, meaning the study used a fake name (human emotional regulation), data was gathered on participants from the beginning before the consent form and they were allowed to delete their data after participating if they wished
-Because it was a concealment it required additional IRB paperwork
-This is just a pilot study, the IRB forms took too long for the class so all groups had to perform pilot studies
-This does not include the gazepoint files do to file size

-Includes:
1) The proposal for our study 
2) The final paper including the results of our study
3) The presentation slides used for the oral presentation of our study
